Vim is a text editor released by Brian Monleenaar in 1991 for the Amiga computer.
The name "Vim" is an acronym for "Vi IMproved" because Vim was created as an extended version of the vi editor.
Although originally designed for the Amiga, Vim has since been developed to by cross-platform.
Vim is popular with some people, but I personally prefer emacs. Vim is OK, emacs is nicer.
emacs is a nice editor available to you on turing.cs.montclair.edu
